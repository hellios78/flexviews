#summary This is a feature roadmap for Flexviews

= Performance Optimization =
  <ul>
  <li>Add gearman worker support for parallel work
  <li>Improve propagation algorithm performance using rolling propagation.</li>
  <li>Add support to run the propagation queries for each base table in parallel</li>
  
= Operational / Usability =

== purge operation ==  
    <ol>
    <li>Add SP to identify oldest uow_id that any view requires for refresh
    <li>Add stored procedure to remove rows from a changelog on a given table before a given uow.
    <li>Add another SP to call that SP either serially or in parallel, via gearman workers
    <li>After the SP in step 4 completes, delete uow_id rows that are no longer needed
