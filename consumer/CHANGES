For changes prior to 1.6.0 RC3 see SVN changelogs


-- 1.6.0 RC3 --
NEW FEATURES:
added add_table.php which is used to add a table changelog to a table.  It simply calls FlexCDC::create_mvlog
table names are now configurable
the replication directory contains FlexSBR, which is a FlexCDC extension which executes SBR statements.

BUG FIXES:
SET statements are now executed
When changing log files, the delimiter was not reset to ;.  This has been fixed.
FlexCDC could ignore some errors from mysqlbinlog if a version 5.0 mysqlbinlog was in the path.  This would result in a loop with an error message continually being displayed.  All mysqlbinlog errors are now detected.
