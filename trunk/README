/****** 1/README
 * NAME
 * |html <pre>
 * Welcome to Flexviews!
 * 
 *  SYNOPSIS
 * 
 * Flexviews is a unique toolkit for the creation and upkeep of MATERIALIZED VIEWS for MySQL.  You may freely use this project in your own projects.
 * Simply keep the above copyright notice intact.
 * 
 * A NOTE ABOUT DATABASES
 * Flexviews must be installed into the `flexviews` schema.  FlexCDC must be configured to use the `flexviews` schema as well.
 * This is because the stored procedures must know where to find the Flexviews metadata, and an absolute reference to schema.table is
 * the only safe way to avoid conflicts between the current default schema and the Flexviews schema.  This is a shortcoming of MySQL
 * stored procedures.  Some day in the future, there will be a 'make' step that allows a global search/replace to switch the name
 * `flexviews` to another name, but for now, you MUST install the tables and stored procedures in the `flexviews` schema.
 *
 * A NOTE ABOUT UPGRADES
 * There is no upgrade script currently.  Please check future releases for more information about upgrading to that release.
 * If you are using an older version of Flexviews, consider disabling all views, dropping the `flexviews` schema, and then 
 * installing from scratch.  
 *
 * MAJOR CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
 * * FlexCDC is completely rewritten as a PHP class and includes unit tests
 * * New documentation built from RoboDOC comments embedded in the SQL stored procedures
 * * Support for auto-changelog mode in FlexCDC, so table change logs do not have to be created manually with flexviews.create_mvlog. Note that you can elect not to use auto-changelog mode and instead manually register table changelogs with flexviews.create_mvlog(schema,table)
 * * New Flexviews website with an online tool to convert SQL statements into Flexviews SQL_API calls.
 *
 * COMING SOON
 * * Flexviews test suite!
 * * Autocleanup of changelog records which are no longer needed.  The old mvlog_autocleanup script has not worked since the introduction of the external consumer.
 * * Examples!
 *
 * Quick Overview
 * -------------------
 * directories:
 *   * consumer - This directory contains FlexCDC which reads binary logs using mysqlbinlog and inserts entries into table change logs
 *   * procs - contains the source to the stored procedures.  usually invoked by install.sql - If you want to modify Flexviews this is probably the place to start.
 *   * php - contains misc scripts of no particular use to a wide audience, but that I want to keep under source control
 *   * schema - contains the CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLE statements for the flexviews schema.  usually invoked by install.sql
 * 
 * Credit where credit is due: 
 * Flexviews currently uses a version of the algorithm described in: 'How to roll a join': http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~beyer/papers/matview_sigmod00.pdf (2000)
 * Flexviews extends this algorithm to distributive aggregate functions with 'summary delta tables': http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=253277&dl= (google scholar has PDF version too)
 * My ideas:
 * Flexviews supports non-distributable aggregate functions such as MIN/MAX/COUNT(DISTINCT) by trading space-for-time using a secondary materialized view called a "sub_view".
 * 
 * Many thanks to the authors of those papers.
