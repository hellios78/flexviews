Welcome to Flexviews!

Flexviews is a unique toolkit for the creation and upkeep of MATERIALIZED VIEWS for MySQL.

My first experience with materialized views was with Oracle 8i.  When my career went in a MySQL direction, the thing I missed most from Oracle was view materialization.  I realised after a few years that my vision of materialized views would likely never make its way into the core MySQL server any time in the near future.

Flexviews supports SELECT-PROJECT-JOIN queries leveraging the algorithm described in 'How to roll a join': http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=335393 (2000)
Flexviews extends this algorithm to distributive aggregate functions with 'summary delta tables' as descbribed in: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=253260.253277 (1997)
Flexviews combines both ideas to support non-distributable aggregate functions such as MIN/MAX/COUNT(DISTINCT) by trading space-for-time using a secondary summary table, though this could be handled better with transparent query rewrite.

Many thanks to the authors.
