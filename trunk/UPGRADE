Upgrading is a two step process.

Step 1 involves adding the upgrade stored procedure to the existing Flexviews installation
 * Connect to MySQL as the 'root' user (or any user with SUPER privilege)
 * Source the upgrade.sql file
   \. upgrade.sql

Step 2 involves actually running the upgrade:
 * From the mysql> prompt:
   CALL flexviews.upgrade();
