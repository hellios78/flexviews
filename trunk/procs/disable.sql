 * SYNOPSIS
 *   flexviews.disable(v_mview_id);
 * FUNCTION
 *   This function drops the table holding the rows for the materialized
 *   view.  There is no warning and the table is dropped as soon as this command is issued.
 *   Flexviews.mview.mview_status is updated to reflect that the view is disabled.
 * INPUTS
 *   v_mview_id - The materialized view id (see flexviews.get_id)
 * RESULT

 * EXAMPLE
 *   call flexviews.disable(flexviews.get_id('test','mv_example'))
 * NOTES
 *   If the view can not be created for some reason, an error message will be displayed.
 *   You can check the values of @MV_DEBUG and @v_sql which will contain the SELECT statement
 *   and CREATE TABLE statement for the view, respectively.
