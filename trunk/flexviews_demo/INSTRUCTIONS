Step 1
--------------------------------
Import the demo.sql file to get the 'demo' database with
a few sample tables.  This data is based on the Microsoft
'Northwind' database.

Step 2

Run the mvlogs.sql script in the demo directory

OR 

Run the following four commands inside the 'demo' database
 and follow the instructions on the screen.  
Basically you just have to copy the output between (and including)
the DELIMITER statements for each table.  This creates the 
triggers and materialized view logs.

call flexviews.create_mvlog('orders', 'demo');
call flexviews.create_mvlog('customers', 'demo');
call flexviews.create_mvlog('order_details', 'demo');
call flexviews.create_mvlog('products', 'demo');



Step 3.
run views.sql file to create the actual materialized views

Step 4
select some sample data from a materialized view

SELECT * from demo.mv_company_sales_total
WHERE CustomerName like 'Ranch%';

Step 5
change some data, for instance:
update demo.order_details set CustomerId = 'XXX' 
where customer_id = 'RANCH';

Step 6
refresh the materialized view:
CALL flexviews.refresh(flexviews.get_id('mv_company_sales_total', 'demo'), 'BOTH');

Step 7
verify the data was removed from the view

SELECT * from demo.mv_company_sales_total
WHERE CustomerName like 'Ranch%';

Step 8
Play!
