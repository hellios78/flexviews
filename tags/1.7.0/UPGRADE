== Upgrading changelogs ==
FlexCDC now logs timestamps differently. TIMESTAMP columns are now
represented as a TIMESTAMP column in the log (instead of DATETIME).

If you have tables with TIMESTAMP columns, you should drop the changelog
and recreate it, or ALTER the changelog table to convert the DATETIME to TIMESTAMP.  TIMESTAMP values will not be correctly logged otherwise.

If you are running 1.6.0+,then execute upgrade.sql

Upgrade from versions earlier than 1.6.0.RC1 is not supported.

Report any problems to the bug tracker.
