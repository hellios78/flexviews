You can use this PHP daemon to rebuild your views periodically according to mview_compute_schedule and mview_apply_schedule tables.  Default schedules are created when views are created.  You can update the schedules with normal SQL DML.

Coming soon API calls to manipulate the schedules.

Requirements:
You'll need the mysqli and pcntl extensions enabled. 

An alternative is to use the EVENT SCHEDULER to refresh your views.
